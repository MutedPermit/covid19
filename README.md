# COVID-19
The world has changed completely in the last weeks, a pandemic was announced in the beginning of 2020 with the virus known as [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2). As many people in the world, I got confined to my house for at least 2 weeks, so I decided to spend some time analyzing data and use this pandemic as a use-case study for me to learn new technologies.

## The plan
For now the plan of this repository is as follows:
    * Set up a mongoDB where to store the information. Also set up a pipeline to fetch data from reliable sources and uptade the DB accordingly.
    * Perform an statistical analysis on the data as well as some visualisation
    * Create an ML model to predict the course of the pandemic.
    * Create a web application for visualization and query of ML model.
    
## Disclaimer
This is a personal project and I don't know how much I can do.
